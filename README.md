# 01-code_refactor
## Description 

Horiseon, a Social Solution Services company requested their website to be updated to meet accessability compliance requirements. 

While making the page accessability compliant and following the "Scouts Rule", I updating the semantics of the coding with updated tags, cleaned up spacing along with other cosmetic aspects and did my best to leave the code better than when I found it. 

I learned a lot about cleaning up coding without breaking it... and how hard it is to fix it once you do break it. Especially, when it is something like a missing " or something so small. It was also fun when you finally fix it and get it to work. Gotta do that victory dance! ^_-

I also looked through several other GitHubs and other pages for ideas and explanations, but didn't really use any of that info. 

Classmates, TA and Virtual TAs were also all HUGE help!
